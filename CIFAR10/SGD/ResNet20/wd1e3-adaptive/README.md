# Adaptive learning rate experiments
This contains the experiments on CIFAR-10 using an adaptive learning rate.
* `epoch-262.h5`: The model with the best validation accuracy among 300 epochs.
* `epoch-300.h5`: The final model after 300 epochs.
* `hist.pkl`: A dict with training and validation accuracy scores and losses over all epochs.
* `nohup.out`: Output of the program.
* `Adaptive...ipynb`: Notebook to generate plots.
